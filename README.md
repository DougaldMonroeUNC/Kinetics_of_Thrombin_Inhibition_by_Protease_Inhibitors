# Kinetics_of_Thrombin_Inhibition_by_Protease_Inhibitors
Repository for the code used in the Blood VTH paper titled The Kinetics and Interplay of Thrombin Inhibition by Four Plasma Protease Inhibitors.

# Placeholder for now.

Code will be deposited with a link to the DOI of the paper as soon as the manuscript appears on the Blood - Vessels, Thrombosis, and Hemostasis site. Manuscript has been accepted but is undergoing journal editing and formatting.

Part of the code was an extension of the really brillant work in:

Owen MJ, Wright JR, Tuddenham EGD, King JR, Goodall AH, Dunster JL. Mathematical models of coagulation-are we there yet? J Thromb Haemost. 2024;22(6):1689-1703. doi:10.1016/j.jtha.2024.03.009
